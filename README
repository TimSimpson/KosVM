KOS in VM
=========

This project is for building and running KallistiOS in a VM inside a Windows
computer or on Ubuntu. I did it because I was too stupid to get this working
in Cygwin and wanted to learn how to do it from scratch. It might be
informative if you're also wondering how to build KallistiOS.


Building on Ubuntu / Lubuntu
----------------------------

Download and run "install_kos.sh".
When it's ready, run "source ~/Tools/dreamcast/environ.sh"
This was tested once in Lubuntu in 2012-12-26 which means by the time you read
this it probably won't work.


Building in Vagrant
-------------------

Execute "vagrant up", then "vagrant ssh" into the machine.
Inside the VM, run "/vagrant/install_kos.sh", then
"source ~/Tools/dreamcast/environ.sh".
